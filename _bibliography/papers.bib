  abstract = {Without relevant human priors, neural networks may learn uninterpretable features. We propose Dynamics of Attention for Focus Transition (DAFT) as a human prior for machine reasoning. DAFT is a novel method that regularizes attention-based reasoning by modelling it as a continuous dynamical system using neural ordinary differential equations. As a proof of concept, we augment a state-of-the-art visual reasoning model with DAFT. Our experiments reveal that applying DAFT yields similar performance to the original model while using fewer reasoning steps, showing that it implicitly learns to skip unnecessary steps. We also propose a new metric, Total Length of Transition (TLT), which represents the effective reasoning step size by quantifying how much a given model's focus drifts while reasoning about a question. We show that adding DAFT results in lower TLT, demonstrating that our method indeed obeys the human prior towards shorter reasoning paths in addition to producing more interpretable attention maps.},

    Gradient-based meta-learning methods leverage gradient descent to learn the commonalities among various tasks. 
    While previous such methods have been successful in meta-learning tasks, they resort to simple gradient descent during meta-testing. 
    Our primary contribution is the MT-net, which enables the meta-learner to learn on each layer's activation space a subspace that the task-specific learner performs gradient descent on. 
    Additionally, a task-specific learner of an MT-net performs gradient descent with respect to a meta-learned distance metric, which warps the activation space to be more sensitive to task identity. 
    We demonstrate that the dimension of this learned subspace reflects the complexity of the task-specific learner's adaptation task, and also that our model is less sensitive to the choice of initial learning rates than previous gradient-based meta-learning methods. 
    Our method achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performance on few-shot classification and regression tasks.},

While graph neural networks (GNNs) have been successful in encoding graph structures, existing GNN-based methods for community detection are limited by requiring knowledge of the number of communities in advance, in addition to lacking a proper probabilistic formulation to handle uncertainty. We propose a simple framework for amortized community detection, which addresses both of these issues by combining the expressive power of GNNs with recent methods for amortized clustering. Our models consist of a graph representation backbone that extracts structural information and an amortized clustering network that naturally handles variable numbers of clusters. Both components combine into well-defined models of the posterior distribution of graph communities and are jointly optimized given labeled graphs. At inference time, the models yield parallel samples from the posterior of community labels, quantifying uncertainty in a principled way. We evaluate several models from our framework on synthetic and real datasets and demonstrate superior performance to previous methods. As a separate contribution, we extend recent amortized probabilistic clustering architectures by adding attention modules, which yield further improvements on community detection tasks.},

    This paper studies the probability distributions of penultimate activations of classification networks. Specifically, we show that, when a classification network is trained with the cross-entropy loss, its final classification layer forms a Generative-Discriminative pair with a generative classifier based on a specific distribution of penultimate activations. More importantly, the distribution is parameterized by the weights of the final fully-connected layer, and can be considered as a generative model that synthesizes the penultimate activations without feeding input data. We empirically demonstrate that this generative model enables stable knowledge distillation in the presence of domain shift, and can also transfer knowledge from a classifier to variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks for class-conditional image generation.

    Deep ensembles excel in large-scale image classification tasks both in terms of prediction accuracy and calibration. Despite being simple to train, the computation and memory cost of deep ensembles limits their practicability. While some recent works propose to distill an ensemble model into a single model to reduce such costs, there is still a performance gap between the ensemble and distilled models. We propose a simple approach for reducing this gap, i.e., making the distilled performance close to the full ensemble. Our key assumption is that a distilled model should absorb as much function diversity inside the ensemble as possible. We first empirically show that the typical distillation procedure does not effectively transfer such diversity, especially for complex models that achieve near-zero training error. To fix this, we propose an augmentation-based distillation strategy that reveals diversity by seeking inputs for which ensemble member outputs disagree. We empirically show that a model distilled with such augmented samples indeed exhibits enhanced diversity, leading to improved performance.

    Meta-learning methods optimize components inside a learning algorithm to achieve low validation loss after task learning. Typically, such methods backpropagate through the entire learning procedure. Although such an approach can successfully learn to learn small tasks, they are fundamentally unable to scale to tasks involving large datasets or requiring long training runs. We propose a meta-learning method that does not suffer from such issues: we first save a set of model checkpoints obtained during regular task learning. Then, we use these checkpoints to train a separate neural network, which we call RiskNet, to mimic the risk functional's value while also producing the same gradients for task learner parameters. We show that our gradient matching component is critical to sample efficiency and performance through experiments in few-shot regression and image classification benchmarks. Furthermore, the resulting model is shown to faithfully mimic the target gradients.

While promising, the scalability of Bayesian pseudocoresets is not yet validated in large-scale problems such as image classification with deep neural networks. On the other hand, dataset distillation methods similarly construct a small dataset such that the optimization with the synthetic dataset converges to a solution similar to optimization with full data. Although dataset distillation has been empirically verified in large-scale settings, the framework is restricted to point estimates, and their adaptation to Bayesian inference has not been explored. This paper casts two representative dataset distillation algorithms as approximations to methods for constructing pseudocoresets by minimizing specific divergence measures: reverse KL divergence and Wasserstein distance. Furthermore, we provide a unifying view of such divergence measures in Bayesian pseudocoreset construction. Finally, we propose a novel Bayesian pseudocoreset algorithm based on minimizing forward KL divergence. Our empirical results demonstrate that the pseudocoresets constructed from these methods reflect the true posterior even in large-scale Bayesian inference problems.}

This paper shows that in such settings, selectively fine-tuning a subset of layers (which we term surgical fine-tuning) matches or outperforms commonly used fine-tuning approaches. Moreover, the type of distribution shift influences which subset is more effective to tune: for example, for image corruptions, fine-tuning only the first few layers works best. We validate our findings systematically across seven real-world data tasks spanning three types of distribution shifts. Theoretically, we prove that for two-layer neural networks in an idealized setting, first-layer tuning can outperform fine-tuning all layers. Intuitively, fine-tuning more parameters on a small target dataset can cause information learned during pre-training to be forgotten, and the relevant information depends on the type of shift.}

We propose DivDis, a simple two-stage framework that first learns a diverse collection of hypotheses for a task by leveraging unlabeled data from the test distribution. We then disambiguate by selecting one of the discovered hypotheses using minimal additional supervision, in the form of additional labels or inspection of function visualization.

    The fluency and factual knowledge of large language models (LLMs) heightens the need for corresponding systems to detect whether a piece of text is machine-written. For example, students may use LLMs to complete written assignments, leaving instructors unable to accurately assess student learning. In this paper, we first demonstrate that text sampled from an LLM tends to occupy negative curvature regions of the model's log probability function. Leveraging this observation, we then define a new curvature-based criterion for judging if a passage is generated from a given LLM. This approach, which we call DetectGPT, does not require training a separate classifier, collecting a dataset of real or generated passages, or explicitly watermarking generated text. It uses only log probabilities computed by the model of interest and random perturbations of the passage from another generic pre-trained language model (e.g, T5). We find DetectGPT is more discriminative than existing zero-shot methods for model sample detection, notably improving detection of fake news articles generated by 20B parameter GPT-NeoX from 0.81 AUROC for the strongest zero-shot baseline to 0.95 AUROC for DetectGPT.

    Conventional approaches to robustness try to learn a model based on causal features. However, identifying maximally robust or causal features may be difficult in some scenarios, and in others, non-causal "shortcut" features may actually be more predictive. We propose a lightweight, sample-efficient approach that learns a diverse set of features and adapts to a target distribution by interpolating these features with a small target dataset. Our approach, Project and Probe (Pro2), first learns a linear projection that maps a pre-trained embedding onto orthogonal directions while being predictive of labels in the source dataset. The goal of this step is to learn a variety of predictive features, so that at least some of them remain useful after distribution shift. Pro2 then learns a linear classifier on top of these projected features using a small target dataset. We theoretically show that Pro2 learns a projection matrix that is optimal for classification in an information-theoretic sense, resulting in better generalization due to a favorable bias-variance tradeoff. Our experiments on four datasets, with multiple distribution shift settings for each, show that Pro2 improves performance by 5-15% when given limited target data compared to prior methods such as standard linear probing.

    Errors of machine learning models can be prohibitively costly, especially in safety-critical settings such as healthcare. However, machine learning may be applicable to such scenarios if the learned model can abstain and defer to a human on difficult examples instead of making errors. In safety-critical settings, we prefer conservative models that defer to humans at the cost of some overall accuracy. Unfortunately, selective classification and out-of-distribution detection are notably difficult as it is hard to anticipate all possible examples. To mitigate this challenge, we focus on the transductive setting, where unlabeled examples from the test distribution are available during training. We propose transductive confidence minimization (TCM), which minimizes prediction confidence on unlabeled test examples while simultaneously optimizing the training objective. We theoretically show that TCM learns a lower bound on the true confidence, and that this property can be leveraged to provably detect examples that are sufficiently different from training examples, regardless of what distribution they came from. In our experiments, TCM consistently shows high performance, achieving the highest OOD detection performance compared to 6 other methods on 9 out of 10 ID->OOD pairs and consistently outperforming methods for selective classification in settings where we test on data from a previously unseen distribution.

  abstract = {The degree to which a task is learnable given different computational constraints shows the amount of usable information at different scales. An instantiation of this idea is the Kolmogorov Structure Function (KSF), which shows how the fit of an optimal $k$-bit description of a given string improves for increasing values of $k$. While conceptually appealing, computing the KSF is infeasible in practice due to the exponentially large search space of all descriptions of a given length, in addition to the unbounded time complexity. This paper proposes the Constrained Structure Function (CSF), a generalization of the KSF that can be computed efficiently by taking into account realistic computational constraints. In addition to being feasible to compute, the CSF of a dataset can be expressed as the sum of datapoint-wise functions which reflect the degree to which each datapoint is typical in the context of the dataset. Empirically, we demonstrate that the CSF can be used for detecting individual datapoints with characteristics such as being easy, mislabeled, or belonging to a hidden subgroup.}
